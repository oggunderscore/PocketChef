# PocketChef - by Kevin Nguyen, Joshua Duncan, Noah Khayat Albirkdar
A multi-platform application designed to generate simple and budget-friendly recipes based on user's preferences powered by Artificial Intelligence

# Description
Pocket Chef is a proposed web and mobile application that acts as an intelligent cooking assistant for young adults and others who are learning how to cook meals independently. The app will provide customized recipe recommendations based on ingredients the user already has available, is willing to shop for, desired complexity level of the dish, user's budget constraints, user's dietary preferences, desired cooking time, and any other relevant factors specified by the user. Pocket Chef aims to suggest recipes that match the circumstances and preferences of each individual user. Pocket Chef aims to make cooking approachable, fun, simple, and educational for its users.
